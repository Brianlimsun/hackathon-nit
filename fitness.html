</header>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
    <h2>Healthy Food

    </h2>
    <p>1.	Water
Drink 8 to 12 cups of water daily.</p>
    <p>2.	Dark Green Vegetables
Eat dark green vegetables at least three to four times a week. Good options include broccoli, peppers, brussel sprouts and leafy greens like kale and spinach</p>
    <p>3.	Whole Grains
Eat whole grains sat least two or three times daily. Look for whole wheat flour, rye, oatmeal, barley, amaranth, quinoa or a multigrain. A good source of fiber has 3 to 4 grams of fiber per serving. A great source has 5 or more grams of fiber per serving.</p>
    <p>4.	Beans and Lentils
Try to eat a bean-based meal at least once a week. Try to add legumes, including beans and lentils, to soups, stews, casseroles, salads and dips or eat them plain.
</p>
    <p>5.	Fish
Try to eat two to three serving of fish a week. A serving consists of 3 to 4 ounces of cooked fish. Good choices are salmon, trout, herring, bluefish, sardines and tuna.</p>
    <p>6.	Berries
Include two to four servings of fruit in your diet each day. Try to eat berries such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries.</p>
    <p>7.	Winter Squash
Eat butternut and acorn squash as well as other richly pigmented dark orange and green colored vegetables like sweet potato, cantaloupe and mango.</p>
    <p>8.	Soy
25 grams of soy protein a day is recommended as part of a low-fat diet to help lower cholesterol levels. Try tofu, soy milk, edamame soybeans, tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP).</p>
    <p>9.	Flaxseed, Nuts and Seeds
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed or other seeds to food each day or include a moderate amount of nuts – ¼ cup – in your daily diet.</p>
    <p>10.	Organic Yogurt
Men and women between 19 and 50 years of age need 1000 milligrams of calcium a day and 1200 milligrams if 50 or older. Eat calcium-rich foods such as nonfat or low-fat dairy products three to four times a day. Include organic choices.</p>
<h2>Healthy habits</h2>
    <p>1. Swimming, health benefits beyond preventing chronic conditions
Swimming is a good physical exercise for diabetes.
Swimming is a low-impact aerobic physical activity that reduces stress on your skeletal system, making it suitable for people of all ages, as well as those recovering from injuries. Try to incorporate a variety of strokes such as freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly, as they work different muscle groups and will provide a total body workout.</p>
    <p>2. Cycle to lose weight and prevent chronic illnesses
Regular aerobic exercises like cycling has many health benefits.</p>
    <p>Combine your workout with your commute — the growing number of cycling paths in Singapore makes it easy for you to cycle around your neighbourhood, or even to and from work via the island’s park connector network. Engaging in regular aerobic exercises like cycling, as a way to clock your recommended 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic physical activity per week, improves cardiovascular fitness and at the same time decreases stress and body fat levels. Cycling is a great way to let go of any tension accumulated at work.

On weekends, try waking up before sunrise to hit the parks before the crowds arrive, and enjoy a cool, leisurely cycle with your partner or family as the sun comes up. Remember your helmet, and ride safely!</p>

    <p>3. Yoga for a balance of strength and flexibility
Doing yoga a few times a week will keep you healthy.

Yoga may seem meditative and relaxing, but it also requires a balance of strength and flexibility, and can prove to be a challenging workout. Beginners should start with a Hatha class to pick up the fundamental poses, before trying out more intensive and faster styles of yoga such as Vinyasa and Ashtanga. Sunrise in the City, which offers free exercise classes, has various yoga studios in their lineup, so you can try out a few as you settle into your yoga practice.</p>
    <p>4. Running your way to better chronic disease prevention
Add some variation to your usual running routine to keep things interesting. One option is to include interval training as part of your exercise programme, where you run at a faster pace for a sustained duration, slow down to let your body recover, and then we speed up again. Alternatively, charge up the terrain by going off-road at MacRitchie Reservoir or Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, which will give you a change of scenery and make your body work harder on the undulating terrain.
Invest in a good pair of running shoes that are suited to both your feet and running patterns, and remember to stretch before and after each run to prevent injury. Lastly, take care of yourself by listening to your body, and easing up the pace if you need to — exercise caution today so you can exercise again tomorrow!</p>
