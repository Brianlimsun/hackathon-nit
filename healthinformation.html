    <h2>Chest Cold </h2>
    <p>What is a chest cold (acute bronchitis)?<br>
        A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That’s what makes you cough. Acute bronchitis can last less than 3 weeks.
    </p>
    <h3>Causes
    </h3>
    <p>A virus usually causes acute bronchitis. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis. But, even in these cases, taking antibiotics is NOT advised and will not help you get better.

    </p>
    <h3>Symptoms
    </h3>
    <p>Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks and can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coughing with or without mucus</li>
        <li>Soreness in the chest</li>
        <li>Feeling tired (fatigue)</li>
        <li>Mild headache</li>
        <li>Mild body aches</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough.

    </p>
    <h3>How to Feel Better</h3>
    <p>Below are some ways you can feel better while your body fights off acute bronchitis:

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get plenty of rest.</li>
        <li>Drink plenty of fluids.</li>
        <li>Use a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer.</li>
        <li>Use saline nasal spray or drops to relieve a stuffy nose.</li>
        <li>For young children, use a rubber suction bulb to clear mucus.</li>
        <li>Breathe in steam from a bowl of hot water or shower.</li>
        <li>Suck on lozenges. Do not give lozenges to children younger than 4 years of age.</li>
        <li>Use honey to relieve cough for adults and children at least 1 year of age or older.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Influenza</h2>
    <p>What is Influenza?</p>
    <p>Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it’s different from the stomach “flu” viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting

    </p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Weakened immune systems</li>
        <li>A body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher.</li>
        <li>Nervous system disorders or conditions that change how the brain processes information.</li>
        <li>And people with certain medical conditions have a higher risk of flu complications, such as:</li>
        <li>People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes.</li>
        <li>People who have had strokes.</li>
        <li>People who are younger than 20 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Symtoms</h3>
    <p>At first, the flu may seem like a cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. Colds usually start slowly. But the flu tends to come on quickly. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu</p>
    <p>Common symptoms of the flu often — but not always — include a fever as well as aching muscles, chills and sweats.</p>
    <p>Other symptoms include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Dry, persistent cough</li>

        <li>Shortness of breath.</li>

        <li>Tiredness and weakness.</li>
        <li>Runny or stuffy nose.</li>

        <li>Sore throat.</li>

        <li>Eye pain.</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>When to see a doctor</h3>
    <p>Most people who get the flu can treat themselves at home and often don’t need to see a healthcare professional.</p>
    <p>If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Taking antiviral medicine to treat the flu may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems.
If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.</li>
        <li>Chest pain.</li>
        <li>Ongoing dizziness.</li>
        <li>Seizures</li>
        <li>Worsening of existing medical conditions.</li>
        <li>Severe weakness or muscle pain.
Emergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as:</li>
        <li>Gray or blue, lips or nail beds.</li>
        <li>Dehydration</li>

    </ul>
